Dashboard for showing real-time visualizations of your app downloads. 

Since I don't have real app download data (open to suggestions for better data streams!), 
the app currently uses Twitter location data to fake it. I've implemented a real-time listener 
connected to the Twitter stream API, using Python's Tweepy library.
